## What is yaml-resume?

yaml-resume is an **open source** initiative to create a YAML-based standard for resumes.

It is a Python package that will help you create a well-formed resume in YAML.

## Why yaml?

YAML is **lightweight**, **easy** and **human readable**.
It is also **easy to process** as the data are in a plaintext format.
